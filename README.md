# Team Portfolio Website

A modern, responsive web application showcasing team members, skills, and projects with a complete client-side authentication system. Built as a university mini-project to demonstrate front-end development and software engineering principles.

## ✨ Features

### 🔐 Authentication System
- Mandatory registration before login
- Login via username or email with password validation
- Client-side authentication using localStorage
- Protected routes – Home page inaccessible without authentication
- Automatic redirect to login for unauthenticated users
- Secure logout clearing session data

### 🎨 Design & UX
- **Enforced Dark Mode** – Consistent dark theme across all pages
- Fully responsive design for all screen sizes
- Clean, modern card-based layouts
- Identical sticky navigation bar on all pages
- Smooth transitions and interactive hover effects
- Professional success/error feedback messages

### 👥 Team Interaction
- Interactive team member profiles
- Individual contact forms for each member
- Form validation with required fields:
  - Full Name
  - Gender
  - Age
  - Role (Owner/Employer)
  - Purpose of Contact
  - Message
- Submission confirmation with team member acknowledgment
- Stable form behavior without unintentional closure

### ⚡ Performance
- Optimized page loading
- Efficient client-side routing
- Minimal dependencies (Vanilla JS only)
